#519# This is your ship

Hold right mouse button and drag the mouse to rotate the camera
#520# You may pan the camera by holding the middle mouse button
#521# Use your mouse's scroll wheel to zoom
#522# You may reset the camera by pressing the highlighted button
#523# Now let's talk about how to move the ship:

You may rotate your ship with the A and D keys. Try to gently rotate your ship clockwise and counter clockwise.
#524# Note that your ship is located in a vacuum. In space, there is no air friction, so your ship will keep its linear and angular velocity until you stop it manually.
#525# Automatic stabilization is very useful if you want to stop your ship's rotation. Activate the stabilizer by pressing the highlighted button or its hotkey (R).
#526# While the stabilizer is active, it will automatically use the ship's engines to stop any rotation.

However, take note, that your fuel is limited. These basic maneuvering engines consume liquid hydrogen. Your current amount of liquid hydrogen is displayed on screen (as highligthed by the arrow).
#527# While active, the rotation stabilizer will counteract all rotation, even when you don't really need it to do so. Because this uses the ship's engines, having the stabilizer on increases the consumption of fuel. So, it may be useful to disable the stabilizer whenever you don't need it.

Disable the stabilizer by pressing its hotkey (R).
#528# Now try to move your ship a little, using keys W S Q E to move it forward, backward, left and right.
#529# Now zoom out and observe the nearest planet and its surroundings.

By now you've probably noticed that your ship isn't stationary; it orbits the nearby planet.
#530# Despite the orbital mechanics in the game, movement here is much simpler than in the real world.

Let's try to approach the nearby asteroid.
Select the highlighted asteroid by clicking it.
#531# Now display relative velocity.
#532# With relative velocity active, and an object selected, you will see two arrows near your ship:

White arrow - direction to the selected object
Orange arrow - velocity vector of your ship relative to the selected object
#533# Now, in order to approach your target, begin to move your ship.

You need to align the orange arrow and the white arrow.
#534# Good. Having the two arrows aligned means that your ship moves straight towards the target.

Keep an eye on the distance and relative speed to your target. Do not crash into it.
Once you approach, decelerate your ship until the orange arrow becomes very short. This means that your relative velocity is almost zero.

Approach the selected target and stop your ship near it.
#535# Good. Let's try again with another asteroid.
#536# Move your ship to highlighted asteroid.
#537# You're getting the hang of this! One more time!

Move your ship to the highlighted asteroid.
#538# Perfect! Now you know how to approach nearby objects.
#539# Now let's mine some resources in order to sell them and earn credits.

Your ship is equipped with a mining laser. In order to activate it, select the mining laser and press the "Toggle" button in the window.

Note that an active mining laser consumes energy; which is displayed in right-top corner of the screen. So deactivate the laser when it is not directed towards an asteroid.

Now mine a nearby asteroid using the mining laser and gather some resources.
#540# During mining, you will see an indicator which shows the laser's current yield.
Note, the closer the mining laser gets to the asteroid, the more effective it becomes.

Now open the cargo interface.
#541# In this mode you can see the contents of every storage container on your ship.
Here you see the ship's fuel, energy and gathered resources.

You may drag and drop resources from one container to another. Right now this is not necessary, so just disable the cargo interface again.
#542# A new space station just arrived in the star system.

Let's dock with the station and refuel the ship.
Select the highlighted space station.
#543# Request permission for docking.
#544# The station will reserve a free docking port for your ship.

Approach the designated docking port and carefully touch it with your own ship's docking port.
#545# Now open the trading panel.
#546# In this window, locate the line "Hydrogen" and press "Buy". After that, select the desired amount (for example 10) and confirm your order.

Also, here you can sell gathered resources. Try to sell your mined ores, and press next when this is completed.
#547# Now let's test a weapon!

Your ship doesn't have a weapon, so you need to expand your ship.
Later you will be able to construct modules yourself, but for now you can buy new modules at the space station.

Select the station and press the "Shipyard" button. A build menu will appear.
#548# In the build menu, select a turret platform.

You will see some mounting points on your ship. Place one turret anywhere on your ship where you want.
#549# Now select a cannon from the build menu and attach it on top of your turret.
#550# Good. In order to use a cannon, you need ammunition.

Buy ammo from the station using the "Trade" button.
#551# After you have purchased some ammo, you should connect your cannon to the storage container holding it.

Open the resource connection manager.
#552# In this mode you will see lines which represent a flow of resources.

Many devices must be connected to storage containers in order to work. Engines should be connected to fuel tanks. Shield generators should be connected to power storages, etc.

Now connect your cannon to the container with ammo by dragging a line between your cannon and the ammo storage. Start at the grey dot on your cannon, then move it to the container.
#553# Now you may undock from the station.

In order to undock, select your docking port and press the docking toggle in its control panel.
#554# Turrets may be operated manually, or you may activate automatic mode.

Let's try manual control.
Select a turret and press "Manual control".
You may also press "Show range" in order to see your weapon's effective range.
#555# Try and fire several test shots and press next.
#556# Congratulations! You have completed the basic tutorial.

If you need additional information, be sure to check the community guide.
#557# You have arrived in the star system; you have a small mining ship with a little hydrogen in the fuel tanks. Fuel enough for a flight to the nearest asteroids and stations. Use your mining laser to gather resources from asteroids, and sell them on any nearby trading station.

Modify your ship at the shipyard and complete missions in order to improve your reputation and gain access to new modules.
